                <p>I take pride in the fact to state that I am the founder person of Cambridge International School. With the assistance of my husband the Chairman Mr.Muthusamy who has spent a large sum of money to establish and continuously uplift the school....
                    Education is a fundamental right of every child and therefore, every child should have the opportunity to get proper education. Unfortunately, the few schools in Kotahena are unable to absorb all the children and the international schools here provide education at a price which is beyond the reach of poor and middle class parents. As a result many children belonging to various communities and ethnic groups are deprived of good education.</p>
                <p>It is with the objective of providing quality education at affordable price that Cambridge International School was established in the year 2000, with two teachers and five students. Mrs.Pamini Vetrichelvan was the first principal. I still remember vividly what I said to Mrs. Pamini Vetrichelvan, when the chairman came to inaugurate the school “ I have provided good education to my children to become engineers,  doctors and accountant. Similarly, I want to give this opportunity for other children in the community so that they become professionals”. With the passage of time the number on roll increased rapidly and the management shifted the school to the present venue.</p>
                <p>Going to school with books is not the be all and end all of education. Education moulds the character of pupils nurtures their knowledge, exploits their creativity for productivity and trains them to become good citizens and professionals to face the tomorrow’s challenge.</p>
                <p>As school developed steadily, Mrs.A.C.N.Jasmin was appointed the principal whom we found to be a strict disciplinarian and workaholic. During her principalship, the school improved by leaps and bounds. Education curriculum was further enhanced, books were imported from overseas publishers, examination papers were streamlined and discipline was enforced to the letter.</p>
                <p>Our development programme has not ceased. A significant amount of money has been already invested to construct modern classrooms, laboratory and on sports facilities, so that we could provide nothing but the best in quality education and extra curricular activities.</p>
                <p>May I take this opportunity to thank all the teachers, parents and the principal for their unstinted support and co-operation for building our school to this reputed position.</p>
                <p> Mrs.K.Muthusamy</p>

                <p>Since attaining independence in 1948, our country has gone through tremendous changes in the sphere of education. A good education is an asset for one to achieve the goal of bright future. Taking into consideration this vital fact, I have launched Cambridge International School for quality education, as there are no better educational institutions in and around Kotahena to meet with the needs and aspirations of the parents and pupils.</p>
                <p>Over the last decade we have invested a significant amount of money for the development of the school in providing a laboratory, a dance room and music room. As further development project, we have started construction work for a new building to provide auditorium and new classroom facilities. Equipped with qualified and experienced teachers, the school is beset with the noble task of moulding the character and personality of the pupils and assist them to become professionals in various fields to face the challenges of the future.
                </p>
                <p>It is my opinion the future challenges could be tackled by restructuring the education and methods of teaching in compliance with the technological advancement to meet with the manpower need of the country. Undoubtedly, Cambridge International is beset with this task to churn out productive manpower to the country.</p>
                <p>I conclude this message with best wishes to students, parents, the principal and teachers......</p>

                <p>I am rejoiced to give this message on the occasion of the eleventh anniversary of Cambridge International School. Launched in the year 2000 on a small scale, today the school with over 600 students on its roll has rendered a decade of dedicated service in the cause of education by implementing the National curriculum and the London curriculum. During the period under review, the school has extended more facilities and produced good result so that it has created a major impact in the realm of education to become one of the leading educational institutes in the island. Equipped with a qualified, experienced and dedicated teaching staff, Cambridge International encourages the students after their secondary education to pursue a degree course of studies in a university, so that they could become professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers and accountants to serve both in the private and state sectors.</p>
                <p>Currently our attention is focused on developing the school to be one of the leading schools in the island and contemplates introducing additional sports and games, extra curricular activities and cultural programs etc, so that each and every child develops mentally, physically and intellectually.</p>
                <p>Within the last decade the Management of the school has been spending a significant amount of money by way of constructing modern and comfortable classrooms, Laboratory, dancing room and library with a view to providing better facilities to the students. Furthermore the new building under construction comprises 42 classrooms, a new state of the art auditorium with additional play area and is expected to be completed in the near future. This will greatly enhance facilities to the students.</p>
                <p>I would like to take this opportunity to admonish the present students that their long path to the future is strewn with pitfalls; they should avoid this and follow the guidance of their parents, principal and teachers to pave the way for a bright future. Finally, I express my whole hearted gratitude to the principal, teachers, non-teaching staff and all the past employees who have contributed in no small measure for the upliftment of the school.</p>

                <p>Our mission is to nurture students to achieve excellence in education to become smart citizens with balanced personalities, who can face the challenges in the new millennium as members of the Global Village. The intention of Cambridge International School is to establish a learning environment that is equipped with modern technology including a modern computer lab and an e-learning centre. With the changes in teaching methodology, using advanced technology to teach has become a necessity. Our purpose is to strengthen students with advanced communication skills by enabling them to use e-learning facilities to improve their knowledge and develop the technical skills.</p>
                <p>We believe that students can be empowered to enable them to become more responsible and develop well balanced personalities. According to our vision, by enhancing their creative abilities and including moral values and good attitudes, we can instill in them patience, compassion, passion to the work hard and humility to treat all others with mutual respect. At the same tie, we believe that students must be strong enough to stand on their own feet with courage and to face any challenges independently and solve problems they face in day to day life.</p>
                <p>Our aim is to ensure that each and every student must complete at least a first degree in a university either in Sri Lanka or anywhere in the world. With the training they should be able to reach near an idealistic situation and ultimately should be able to achieve self actualization with this education with the foundation that they get at Cambridge International School.</p>
                <p>To achieve all the above we practice Good Governance in a systematic and methodical way. The culture of the school has evolved by valuing every one’s identity and maintaining a high standard of discipline that will enhance the image of the school. I wish the students and staff of the school the very best to live a life to it fullest potential.</p>

                <p>It is a great privilege for me to pen a few lines from the experience and inspiration at Cambridge International School. It is obvious that the formal education is vital for children to face challenges in the rapid world. Therefore the initial and secondary formation and education are to be given concretely under a conducive environment, with advanced adequate facilities and by well experienced teachers.</p>
                <p>The children of Cambridge International School are really fortunate to enjoy an amiable atmosphere, ample learning facilities and efficient, professional teachers.It is highly inspiring the tireless and constant effort taken by the management to provide high standard education at an enormous, new building. The students of Cambridge International School are given opportunities to excel in studies, sports and to be creative and concentrative with Yoga practice.</p>
                <p>It is notable that the guidance given by the management and the pre-plan in every endeavour makes our events & occasions very successful and colourful. Our school also never fails in forming our students to be disciplined and to have a good conduct. The collective effort and finding new methods of imparting students by teachers is indispensible.   I have no doubt that the children of our school will face the challenges in the future very easily and the name of our Alma Mata will reach far and wide.</p>
